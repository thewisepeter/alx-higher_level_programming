0x02. Python - import & modules

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.

For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a file called fibo.py in the current directory with the following contents:

Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).
