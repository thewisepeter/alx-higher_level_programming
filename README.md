The Next Chapter in my ALX journey. 

High-level programming languages are programming languages that are designed to be easy to read and write for humans, with a syntax that is closer to natural language than to machine language. They abstract away many of the details of computer hardware and provide higher-level constructs, such as variables, functions, objects, and classes, that make it easier to write complex programs.

Some examples of high-level programming languages include Python, Java, C++, Ruby, and JavaScript. These languages are typically compiled or interpreted, and they provide a variety of features to help developers write code quickly and efficiently. These features may include garbage collection, dynamic typing, memory management, object-oriented programming, and support for libraries and frameworks.
