0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes. In OOP, objects are the fundamental building blocks that encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). The key concepts in OOP are:

Classes: Classes define the blueprint or template for creating objects. They encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit.

Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They represent specific instances of the class and can have their own unique data values while sharing the same behaviors defined by the class.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods within a class. It hides the internal details of an object and allows interaction with the object through well-defined interfaces.

Inheritance: Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes. It promotes code reuse and enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be overridden in subclasses, providing different implementations while maintaining a consistent interface.

Overall, OOP provides a way to structure and organize code by modeling real-world entities as objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and flexibility in software development.
