0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web
pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web applications possibleâ€”applications with which you can interact
directly without doing a page reload for every action.

It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do
with the programming language named Java. The similar name was
inspired by marketing considerations rather than good judgment. When
JavaScript was being introduced, the Java language was being heavily
marketed and was gaining popularity. Someone thought it was a good
idea to try to ride along on this success. Now we are stuck with the
name.
